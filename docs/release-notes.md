# Release notes: bounded memory management

## `BsonValue` CLR collection compatibility

`new BsonValue(object)` now supports CLR arrays, lists, and dictionaries as
mutable BSON containers. `AsArray`, `AsDocument`, JSON conversion, comparison,
and database persistence all use one stable BSON container for each wrapped
value.

Collection inputs are copied during construction. Later changes to the source
list or dictionary are therefore not reflected in the `BsonValue`. Dictionary
keys use case-insensitive BSON document semantics; when source keys differ only
by case, the last value enumerated wins.

`BsonValue.GetHashCode()` now agrees with `Equals()`: numerically equal values
(`1`, `1L`, `1.0`, `1m`), binary values with the same bytes, UTC-equivalent
dates, and arrays/documents with equal content share a hash code. Collection
hash codes are content-based, so they change when the collection is mutated.

Comparing a double that decimal cannot hold (NaN, infinity, or a magnitude of
2^96 and above) against an `Int32`, `Int64` or `Decimal` used to throw
`OverflowException` from `CompareTo`/`Equals`. Such a double now orders by its
sign (NaN and negative values first) and never compares equal.

## Stream ownership change

Streams supplied through `EngineSettings.DataStream`, `LogStream`, and
`TempStream`, or through the `LiteDatabase(Stream)` constructor, remain open
after the database is disposed. The caller owns these streams and must dispose
them after disposing the database. Engine-created file and temporary streams
are still closed by the engine.

Applications that previously relied on database disposal to close supplied
streams should add explicit stream disposal, for example:

```csharp
using (var stream = File.Open("data.db", FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
using (var database = new LiteDatabase(stream))
{
    // Use the database. It is disposed before the caller-owned stream.
}
```

## Transaction and WAL cleanup

Repeated safepoints reuse the transaction's existing unconfirmed WAL page
positions. A confirmation page is always appended after the transaction's
other pages, retaining the existing recovery format and ordering. Readers of
committed versions continue to use separate, immutable WAL positions.

Transaction cleanup errors no longer prevent removal from the transaction
registry, clearing the thread's transaction slot, or releasing its transaction
lock. Explicit cleanup also releases collection locks on their owning thread.

Transactions no longer run managed cleanup on the finalizer thread. The
monitor already retains registered transactions and releases their pages and
readers during explicit engine disposal. Applications must still finish their
transactions on the originating thread and dispose their databases; garbage
collection does not release abandoned thread-affine locks in a live engine.

## Connection strings and equals signs in filenames

Raw paths such as `data/test=1.db` now work in the string constructors.
A single unknown `key=value`, including `tenant=acme` or a typo such as
`filenam=production.db`, is treated as a filename; this changes the previous
custom-option behavior. Input containing both `=` and `;` is parsed as options
and never falls back to a filename. Use `new ConnectionString { Filename = path }`
for arbitrary paths. See [the parsing compatibility notes](connection-string-parsing.md)
for explicit syntax and integration requirements.
